This site is a work in progress

- Remove these spinning shapes
- Fix whatever is going on with the header where if your screen is too big then the "Digital Craftsman" gets cutoff by the rightmost edge
- Add images for the Selected Work section (and change that title to something more appropriate)
- Figure out whatever is going on with that cropping
- Add some more hyperlinks to work that I've definitely done so far
- Add way too many A&M logos
